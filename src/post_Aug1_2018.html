            <h1>Overview:</h1>
            <p>Swing is a Java graphics library that allows the user to quickly and efficiently implement and use graphics to create a desktop application. Swing is quite easy to learn as the basic concepts and ideas are all you need to know to create very intricate applications. Swing can be used for many types of applications including: Games, TextEdit softwares, Applications such as calculators, etc. The list goes on and on. The resources that swing provide the user allows them to create a vast variety of applications showing the true capabilities of Swing and its ability to create desktop applications.</p>

        <!--Introduction Area Elements-->
        <div id="introduction-area">
            <h1>Introduction:</h1>
            <p>Just like any other graphics library, Swing has special functions that allow the user to create their own custom application. To get started, let’s first import Swing and create a basic window. We can create a window by using the JFrame utility that Swing provides us. This is basically the shell of our application and the container for all the graphics we will be displaying.</p>
            <div class="code-box">
                <code>
                    <pre>
          //Import statement for JFrame
          import javax.swing.JFrame; 
          public class Main{
              public static void main(String[] args){
                  //Creating the window object using the JFrame class
                  JFrame window = new JFrame();
                  //Setting the display size to 500px * 500px
                  window.setSize(500, 500);
                  //Takes String input and sets the title of the window to “Basic Application”
                  window.setTitle(“Basic Application”);
                  //This is very important. Observe that this function enables the window to actually close. Without this, after running the program, you wouldn't be able to actually close the window. You would have to manually terminate the program
                  window.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); 
                  //Obviously you need to set the visibility to true :)
                  window.setVisible(true);
              }
          }
                    </pre>
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>When I first started, I had a hard time remembering all of these functions. The only way to learn it is to keep applying it just like any other skill in the real world.</p>
        </div>
        <hr id="line">
        <!--JPanel Area Elements-->
        <div id="jpanel-overview">
            <h1>JPanel:</h1>
            <p>We have our frame, but where is our picture? In Swing, you can think of the JPanel class as the picture that you place inside of the frame. JPanel is the actual container for all the graphics and JFrame is a JPanel container. To create a JPanel, you have to create a class that inherits all the attributes of the JPanel class.</p>
            <p>Create a new file called Panel.java in the same package as Main.java:</p>
            <div class="code-box">
                <code>
                    <pre>
          //Import statement for JPanel
          import javax.swing.JPanel
          //Take note of the “extends” keyword. It shows that inheritance is taking place
          public class Panel extends JPanel{
              //Constructor
              public Panel(){

              }
          }
                    </pre>
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>Now back in our Main.java file, let’s add the JPanel. Below the window object initialization line:</p>
            <div class="code-box">
                <code>
                    <pre>
          //Adds a new Panel object to the window
          window.add(new Panel());
                    </pre>
                </code>
            </div>
        </div>
        <hr id="line">
        <!--Thread Area Elements-->
        <div id="thread-area">
            <h1>Thread:</h1>
            <p>Okay, now we need some type of loop that keep the application running until the user wants to quit it. In java, every line of code inside of the main function executes only once… just once. We don’t want that to happen to our game, so we have to create a game loop that allows the game to keep updating the frames. In swing, we use something called a thread to execute a program. A thread is basically a path that the compiler follows. To use the thread, we have to implement the Runnable class. You can get more info about the Runnable class at: <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Runnable.html">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Runnable.html</a>.</p>

              private Thread thread;
              //Boolean value will be useful for the loop later
              private boolean isRunning;
              //The target frame rate we want the computer to run at
              private int targetFPS;
              public Panel(){
                  //Initializing thread vars
                  //Observe keyword “this” 
                  thread = new Thread(this);
                  isRunning = true;
                  targetFPS = 60;
              }
              //Initial method that comes with the Runnable class. All the updates for the graphics and rendering will sprout out of here

            <p>Alright, we have created the JPanel, now let’s move onto the root of the application, the loop. This allows us to control frame updates, rendering, and possibly everything that is vital to the application.</p>

        <div id="graphics-area">
            <h1>Beginning Graphics:</h1>
            <p>Finally!!! The good part. We will now start displaying graphics to the screen. To do this, we have to create a new function in the Panel.java file. It is called “paintComponent(g)”. paintComponent has 1 parameter, a Graphics object. Using this graphics object and its functions, we will be able to display graphics onto the window.</p>
            <p>In the Panel.java class, create a new method called paintComponent with a Graphics object as a parameter.</p>
            <div class="code-box">
                <code>
                    <pre>

          import java.awt.Graphics2D;

                </code>
            </div>
            <p>In this function, we will be able to display different polynomials and distinct shape using the classes that the awt library provides us.</p>
